# calculator
A simple calculator designed using JS

an app with two input fields which takes string as an input,

The values of the input is then converted into Number using Number() method

The values are then operated using the four buttons - Add, Sub, Mul, Div

These are done by accessing JS through DOM 

First version is just JS and HTML. I will work on it further to add styles to the project.
